Linear Hierarchy Package for R

The Linear Hierarchy package contains functions for analyzing dyadic
interactions of a group of individuals and generating a score for
individuals to be used in subsequent analysis. There are several differnet
scoring algorithms that may be parameterized according in order to generate
player scores to the users liking. 

Current development plans include the implementation of the following player 
rating algorithms:

- Elo Rating 
- I&S*I
- David's Score
- Bayesian Approximation Ranking
