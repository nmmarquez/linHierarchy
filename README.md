Linear Hierarchy Package for R

The Linear Hierarchy package contains functions for analyzing dyadic
interactions of a group of individuals and generating a score for
individuals (players) to be used in subsequent analysis. There are several different
scoring algorithms within the package that may be differentially parameterized
in order to generate player ratings. 

Current development plans include the implementation of the following player 
rating algorithms:

- Elo Rating 
- I&S*I
- David's Score
- Bayesian Approximation Ranking
