\title{Generate a series of elo ratings from interaction data}
\usage{
eloTable(intData, initial = 1000, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{intData}{an onject of class "interData".}

\item{initial}{the starting score for all participants in the group.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
An object of the class eloTable which contains a vector of players
in the graoup, the time range of interactions, and a data frame sorted by
time containing any changes in an individuals elo rating.
}
\description{
Given an object of the class "interData" will produce a series of elo
ratings up until the latest interaction in the interData object.
}
\details{
Using the methods described in Neumann et al 2011. a series of Elo
ratings are generated from interaction data. Initial scores may either be a
single numeric value or a vector of integers correspong to the players
element of intData. Further arguments are passed to the findK and
singleOutcome functions and include the paramters; kScaleBounds, kFactors,
and minTresh.

\examples{
# generate generic data
interactions <- data.frame (a = sample (letters [1:10], 100, T),
                            b = sample (letters [1:10], 100, T),
                            o = sample (c(-1,-1,0,1,1), 100, T),
                            d = Sys.time () + runif (100, 40, 160))
# convert to interData object
id1 <- intTableConv (interactions)
# produce eloTable object
eloTable (id1)
